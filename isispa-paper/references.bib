@article{Berezhnoy2009Automatic,
    abstract = {{Spatial characteristics play a major role in the human analysis of paintings. One of the main spatial characteristics is the pattern of brushstrokes. The orientation, shape, and distribution of brushstrokes are important clues for analysis. This paper focuses on the automatic extraction of the orientation of brushstrokes from digital reproductions of paintings. We present a novel technique called the (prevailing orientation extraction technique (POET)). The technique is based on a straightforward circular filter and a dedicated orientation extraction phase; it performs at a level that is undistinguishable from that of humans. From our experimental results we may conclude that POET supports the automatic extraction of the spatial distribution of oriented brushstrokes. Such an automatic extraction will aid art experts in their analysis of paintings.}},

@article{Canny1986Computational,
    abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

@inproceedings{Belongie2001Matching,
    abstract = {We present a novel approach to measuring similarity between shapes and exploit it for object recognition. In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes, (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. Dis-similarity between two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks, handwritten digits and the {COIL} dataset},

    abstract = {Art historians have long observed the highly characteristic brushstroke styles of Vincent van Gogh and have relied on discerning these styles for authenticating and dating his works. In our work, we compared van Gogh with his contemporaries by statistically analyzing a massive set of automatically extracted brushstrokes. A novel extraction method is developed by exploiting an integration of edge detection and clustering-based segmentation. Evidence substantiates that van Gogh's brushstrokes are strongly rhythmic. That is, regularly shaped brushstrokes are tightly arranged, creating a repetitive and patterned impression. We also found that the traits that distinguish van Gogh's paintings in different time periods of his development are all different from those distinguishing van Gogh from his peers. This study confirms that the combined brushwork features identified as special to van Gogh are consistently held throughout his French periods of production (1886-1890).},

    abstract = {"This modern treatment of computer vision focuses on learning and inference in probabilistic models as a unifying theme. It shows how to use training data to learn the relationships between the observed image data and the aspects of the world that we wish to estimate, such as the {3D} structure or the object class, and how to exploit these relationships to make new inferences about the world from new image data. With minimal prerequisites, the book starts from the basics of probability and model fitting and works up to real examples that the reader can implement and modify to build useful vision systems. Primarily meant for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, the detailed methodological presentation will also be useful for practitioners of computer vision. [bullet] Covers cutting-edge techniques, including graph cuts, machine learning and multiple view geometry [bullet] A unified approach shows the common basis for solutions of important computer vision problems, such as camera calibration, face recognition and object tracking [bullet] More than 70 algorithms are described in sufficient detail to implement [bullet] More than 350 full-color illustrations amplify the text [bullet] The treatment is self-contained, including all of the background mathematics [bullet] Additional resources at www.computervisionmodels.com"--},

    abstract = {The paper provides insights into our efforts to develop techniques for the analysis of visual art. The {AUTHENTIC} project aims at creating a collection of software tools to support art experts in their assessments of the authenticity of paintings. We describe our progress on the automatic analysis of the visual texture of the paintings of Vincent van Gogh. The texture-analysis technique reveals two main clusters of brushstroke shapes used in the paintings by Van Gogh. These qualifying results lead us to conclude that the use of advanced digital analysis techniques will change the way in which the authentication of visual art is performed},
