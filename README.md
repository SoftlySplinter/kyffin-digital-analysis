#Kyffin Williams: Digital Analysis of Paintings.

Sir John “Kyffin” Williams was a landscape painter from Wales who’s work was predominantly
based in Wales and Patagonia. His work, and associated metadata collected by the National Library
ofWales, allows for some inter esting analysis; particularly that of temporal or geological
data for a given painting.

Temporal analysis will be the focus of this project as it allows for a diverse range of techniques;
from statistical analysis of RGB values of the paintings to looking at the length and
style of paintbrush strokes. The ultimate aim of this being to accurately place the year of a
given painting which has no metadata collected.
