\section{Project Summary}
%==============================================================================
Sir John ``Kyffin'' Williams was a landscape painter from Wales whose work was predominantly based 
in Wales and Patagonia. His work, with associated metadata collected by Gareth Lloyd Roderick and 
the National Library of Wales, allows for some interesting analysis; particularly that of temporal 
or geological data for a given painting.

Temporal analysis will be the focus of this project as it allows for a diverse range of techniques;
from statistical analysis of RGB values of the paintings to looking at the length and style of 
paintbrush strokes. 

Whilst it would be nice to be able to predict the age of a painting with no known year, it is far
more interesting to try to guess the year of paintings where the date is known. This allows for
cross-validation of the techniques employed to guess the year. This project will use leave-one-out
cross-validation for simplicity as the data set is small enough to allow this computationally 
expensive technique.

%==============================================================================
\section{Current Progress}
%==============================================================================

\subsection{Design}
An initial UML class diagram is depicted by figure~\ref{fig:init-class}. This design will allow 
additional techniques, both analysis and machine learning based, to be added easily. Command line
arguments, or later a GUI front-end, will be used to specify which techniques should be used.

The GUI elements depicted are used for visualising the analysed data or results of the machine
learning algorithms.

\begin{figure}[p]

\caption{Initial Design}
\label{fig:init-class}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Colour Space Statistical Analysis}
With the design solidified, I begun to work on the statistical analysis of digital images. The 
easiest of these techniques is to read the image pixel by pixel, taking the various intensities at
that pixel, then averaging them out over the whole image.

The most common colour space used is RGB (Red, Green, Blue), where each pixel holds three different
intensities, one for each colour with a value of 0 to 255.

Using this analysis I plotted a graph of all paintings with a known year against the different 
intensities (see figure~\ref{fig:mean-rgb-by-year}). As can be seen from this graph, the RGB values
tend to fluctuate without much correlation between year.

\begin{figure}[p]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/kyffin-rgp-avg.png}
\caption{Mean RGB intensities by year.}
\label{fig:mean-rgb-by-year}
\end{figure}

Another popular colour space used in image processing is HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) as it shows
variations in colour, saturation and brightness separately (unlike RGB where all three values are
affected by changes in brightness). It was a simple matter of changing the existing code for RGB
so that it would analyse HSV values instead.

I also decided it would be an improvement to average all values in the same year together to help
show changes as time goes on (see figure~\ref{fig:mean-hsv-by-year}).

\begin{figure}[p]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/hsv-legend-12-11-01.png}
\caption{Mean HSV intensities by year.}
\label{fig:mean-hsv-by-year}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Histogram Analysis}
With colour-space analysis complete, the next sensible step was to start generating colour 
histograms from Kyffin Williams paintings.

A histogram is a nice way of displaying the distribution of colour in a given image and is 
therefore a more useful representation of a painting than colour-space averages.

As with before, histograms can be taken from different colour spaces, currently only the program
can only generate RGB histograms, but it is trivial to include HSV histograms too.

\subsection{Nearest Neighbour Classification}
Having finished the analysis techniques, then next part was to create a simple classification 
algorithm. The simplest of which is 1-Nearest Neighbour, that is; take the ``Nearest'' training
example to the example to be classified and classify the year of this example with the year of the
nearest example (see figure~\ref{fig:1-nn}).

This simple algorithm can be expanded to be a K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm without too much effort
(see figure~\ref{fig:k-nn}). 


\subsubsection{Distance Measures}
Part of the analysis needed to include a way of measuring the distance of two outputs from the
associated technique; for points in space distance measures such as Manhattan distance 
(figure~\ref{eq:manhattan}) or euclidean distance (figure~\ref{eq:euclidean}). This distance 
measure is then used by the machine learning module

\begin{figure}[p]
\[
d = \sum^X_{x=0}{|a_x - b_x|}
\]

\(X\): All dimensions present in both \(a\) and \(b\).\\
\(a\): The first point.\\
\(b\): The second point.

\label{eq:manhattan}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[p]
\[
d = \sqrt{\sum^X_{x=0}{(a_x - b_x)^2}}
\]

\(X\): All dimensions present in both \(a\) and \(b\).\\
\(a\): The first point.\\
\(b\): The second point.
\caption{Euclidean Distance}
\label{eq:euclidean}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Brushstroke Analysis}
After these techniques are implemented there is a lot of space to develop new techniques specific 
to both painting analysis and to Kyffin Williams. One very interesting technique is to analyse the
brush strokes the artist made on the painting. It is clear from looking at his work that he 
dramatically reduces the number of brush strokes he makes as time goes on. 

According to the \textsc{authentic} project ``The digital extraction of brushstrokes proceeds in 
two steps: (I) contour enhancement, and (II) quantification of brushstroke 
shape''\cite{citeulike:11446581}. They perform contour enhancement by applying a circular filter to
the image, this filter picks out the characteristic parallel contours of brushstrokes. For the 
works of Kyffin Williams this may not work as well as he typically used a pallet knife %FIXME was this the right tool?
to paint with, instead of a regular paintbrush.

Once these contours are enhanced you can then fill a closed area for each brushstroke, reduce this 
to a thin line and finally fit some form of polynomial function to this line. Again, for the Kyffin
Williams project the third part of this may not be applicable as the \textsc{authentic} project
specialises in ensuring the authenticity of a painting and does so by verifying that the 
brushstrokes in one painting match the style of Van Gogh. Even looking at the number of visible
brushstrokes in Kyffin Williams' work may be enough to classify a painting.

%==============================================================================
\subsection{Machine Learning Goals}
%==============================================================================
The Machine Learning (ML) module is designed to classify analysed paintings to the training 
examples in order to get the approximate year the were created.

Machine Learning on it's own is a large and complex field, so the techniques used here may be
simple to ensure the project completes on deadline.

\subsubsection{K-Nearest Neighbour Classification}
The simplest solution to the classification problem is to take the nearest neighbour of a given,
analysed, painting and set the year of the new example to the one of the existing example. This
is highly dependant on the type of analysis, noise in the training examples, etc.

It is, however, very simple to implement (see Figure~\ref{fig:1-nn}), with simple modification
one can easily change 1-Nearest Neighbour to K-Nearest Neighbour (see Figure~\ref{fig:k-nn}) and
approach with different values for K to give a potentially more accurate answer. K-Nearest 
Neighbour also has options for interpreting the result, by taking the modal result or a mean of all
the results.

\begin{algorithmic}
\State $bestDistance \gets \infty$
\For{$x = 1 \to X$}
	\If{$distance(a, x) < bestDistance$}
		\State $bestDistance \gets distance(a, x)$
	\EndIf
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}

			\State $temp \gets kBest[k]$
			\State $kBest[k] \gets cur$

You need to include an annotated bibliography. This should list all relevant web pages, books, journals etc. that you have consulted in researching your project. Each reference should include an annotation. 

The purpose of the section is to understand what sources you are looking at.  A correctly formatted list of items is sufficient. You might go further and make use of bibliographic tools, e.g. BibTeX in a LaTeX document, could be used to provide citations, for example \cite{NumericalRecipes} \cite{MarksPaper} \cite[99-101]{FailBlog} \cite{kittenpic_ref}.  The bibliographic tools are not a requirement, but you are welcome to use them.   

You can remove the above {\em Your Bibliography} section heading because it will be added in by the renewcommand which is part of the bibliography. The correct annotated bibliography information is provided below.
