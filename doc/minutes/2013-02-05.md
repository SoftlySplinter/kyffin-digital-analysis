Meeting for 05 Feb 2012
=======================

* More graphs!
* Feature selection and feature weighting :)
* It's time for Weka :)
* SVM are more classification than regression. We'd rather look at regression than classification.
* Two directions:
    * ML route -> Features into ML techniques.
    * Stroke detection.
* Weka now, stroke detection and count the stroke or whatever :)



Sidepoints
