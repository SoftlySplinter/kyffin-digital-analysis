Dissertation Meeting 29/01/2012
===============================

* Full results as important as true results. Write every attempt down, not just the successful ones :)
* Combine lots of weak classifiers and combine them together to vote or similar.
* Segmentation to get size of strokes - edge and colour.
* "Painting" brushstrokes onto the image.
* Side project: Get some general public to look at 10-20 Kyffin paintings from across his life with years. Then give 10-20 paintings without years and get them to put them in order. If there are regular misclassification's there might be something else. Art historians might be interested in this :)
* MORE BLOG POSTS!!!
