Meeting for 12/02/2013
======================

**Weka and paintings by year are the priority**

* Weka, weka, weka
* Data -> ARFF 
* If contributing put into the diss
* Judy Greensmith at Nottingham - Concept Drift - trying to learn how something changes over time. Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) worth looking into.
* Demo went well :)
* Exemplar - Expert "most representative" painting for each year.
    * Exemplar to say which is nearest.
    * Or use exemplar to feed back into classification.
    * Work out the exemplar from ML. If the same as the experts: Clustering and cluster centriod in the feature space (might not be a actual painting)
* Still want to do stroke analysis. Some way of segmenting the painting in the sense of which the artist created it, rather than by colour.
* Representation of paintings by year before Monday
