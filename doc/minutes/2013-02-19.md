Meeting for 19/02/2013
======================

* Weka
    * Not as good as KNN?
    * LCS again?
* Exemplar stuff looks really interesting
    * Take 1969, statistically using this measure this painting is the most 1969.
    * Clustering? Not quite
    * GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model) - [Mean and StdDev] should be good for this. (side)
* Change mean to median on knn - might be an easy win (especially for 5 year bins). Might be worth exploring mode too.

* Look at, in more detail, where we're going wrong.
    * For each classification step, which painting is misclassified most.

* Llyod's improved "database".

* Start thinking about the write up :)
    * Hannah happy to give feedback on drafts, earlier rather later.
    * Hannah doesn't mind reading it all.
    * Chapter plan.

* Thinking about the dissertation plan:
    * Good way of thinking what needs to be done, what's left to go, etc.
    * Bibliography - EVERYTHING.
    * Coherent story of things and what happened, etc.
