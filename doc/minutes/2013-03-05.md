Meeting for 5/3/2013
====================
* Graphing by k-NN.
* One question:
    * If you take all the paintings in a year and work out, using the features you have, which is the most central. "Statistically Chosen Exemplar" compare to the "Artistically Chosen Exemplar".
* Double check on steerable and gabor filters into histogram.
    * Gabor -> Check 1/8 pi (empirical question).
* Results on median.


* Scatter plots and tables (one or two scatter plots for good, some for bad, table for all restuls).

| Method | 1-NN | 2-NN | ... | X-NN |


* PCA looking at for "stick everything together" option :)
