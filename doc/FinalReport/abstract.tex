Computer vision has addressed many problems in art, but has not yet looked in detail at the way 
artistic style can develop and evolve over the course of an artistâ€™s career. The project takes 
a computational approach to modelling stylistic change in the body of work amassed by Sir John 
Kyffin Williams, a nationally renowned and prolific Welsh artist. Using images gathered 
from catalogues and online sources, a leave-one-out methodology is used to classify paintings by 
year; despite the variation in image source, size, and quality significant correlations between 
predicted year and actual year can be obtained, and the age of a painting is able to be 
classified within 15 years, for around 70\% of the dataset. The incorporation of expert knowledge 
within this framework by consdering a subset of paintings chosen as exemplars by a scholar 
familiar with Williams' work has also been investigated.
