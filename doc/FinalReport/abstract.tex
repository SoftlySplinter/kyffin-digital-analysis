Computer vision has addressed many problems in art, but has not yet looked in detail at the way 
artistic style can develop and evolve over the course of an artistâ€™s career. In this paper we 
take a computational approach to modelling stylistic change in the body of work amassed by Sir 
John ``Kyffin''Williams, a nationally renowned and prolific Welsh artist. Using images gathered 
from catalogues and online sources, we use a leave-one-out methodology to classify paintings by 
year; despite the variation in image source, size, and quality we are able to obtain significant 
correlations between predicted year and actual year, and we are able to guess the age of the 
painting within 15 years, for around 70\% of our dataset. We also investigate the incorporation of
expert knowledge within this framework by consdering a subset of paintings chosen as exemplars by 
a scholar familiar with Williams' work
