Sir John ``Kyffin'' Williams was a Welsh landscape painter widely regarded as the defining artist of Wales during the 20\textsuperscript{th} century.

%FIXME Find out the name of the art historian at NLW.
???, an Art Historian working with the National Library of Wales has collected a lot of information about Kyffin Williams' paintings; including, where known, the date the painting was created (or a range of years where the exact year is not know) and the location depicted by the painting. 

This information allows for some interesting analysis to be performed on Kyffin Williams' paintings: temporal analysis to classify the date of paintings for which the actual date is unknown or to narrow down the range of dates; or geographical analysis to be able to classify the location the painting depicts.

Of the two, temporal anaysis is the more viable; geographical analysis would have to assume the scene was painted fairly exactly. Most artists take liberties with the details of the subject making it even more difficult to accurately location the painted location. Temporal analysis can potentially be more concrete as changes in style are likely to be less extreme than the liberties taken with the details of a subject.
