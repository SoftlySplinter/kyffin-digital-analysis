\chapter{Testing}

%Detailed descriptions of every test case are definitely not what is required here. What is important is to show that you adopted a sensible strategy that was, in principle, capable of testing the system adequately even if you did not have the time to test the system fully.

%Have you tested your system on 'real users'? For example, if your system is supposed to solve a problem for a business, then it would be appropriate to present your approach to involve the users in the testing process and to record the results that you obtained. Depending on the level of detail, it is likely that you would put any detailed results in an appendix.

\section{Overall Approach to Testing}
As this is a research-based project, it is difficult to perform any for of unit, functional or 
requirements testing. Most testing is based on validating the results of analysis and 
classification techniques.
