Jade Goodyear, Kate Howlett, Sam Clements, Yarrow Paddon-Butler for being great friends
in times of serious need.\\

Sir John Kyffin Williams for providing such an interesting subject matter.\\

My co-authors of the paper entitled ``Can we an artist's work from catalogue photographs'', 
included in Appendix~\ref{sec:paper} - Lloyd, Hannah and Lorna. From which some content was 
derived. Although a lot of the text of this paper was not my own work, the underlying code on 
which the paper is based is.\\

Finally, Hannah M. Dee, who has been everything a student could want in a supervisor, who has had
the craziest ideas that have paid dividends and for pushing me to cite Rolf Harris. I cannot thank
her enough, especially with all the work she made on our paper.\\
