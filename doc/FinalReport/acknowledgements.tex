%To Llyod, Hannah and the Cooper's Arms for setting the scene for this crazy project.

%To Jade, Kate, Yarrow and Sam for being great friends in times of need.

%To Kyffin Williams himself, for being such an interesting artist.

%To the writers of the neumerous libaraies I have used in this project, without which I would have been stumped at day one.

%Finally, though she already been mentioned, to Hannah who has been everything a student could want in a supervisor and a lot more. For the crazy ideas and piles of reading material. And for getting me to cite Rolf Harris.
