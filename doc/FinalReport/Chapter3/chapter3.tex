\chapter{Design}



%You should concentrate on the more important aspects of the design. It is essential that an overview is presented before going into detail. As well as describing the design adopted it must also explain what other designs were considered and why they were rejected.

%The design should describe what you expected to do, and might also explain areas that you had to revise after some investigation.

%Typically, for an object-oriented design, the discussion will focus on the choice of objects and classes and the allocation of methods to classes. The use made of reusable components should be described and their source referenced. Particularly important decisions concerning data structures usually affect the architecture of a system and so should be described here.

%How much material you include on detailed design and implementation will depend very much on the nature of the project. It should not be padded out. Think about the significant aspects of your system. For example, describe the design of the user interface if it is a critical aspect of your system, or provide detail about methods and data structures that are not trivial. Do not spend time on long lists of trivial items and repetitive descriptions. If in doubt about what is appropriate, speak to your supervisor.


\section{Overall Architecture}
The basic architecture for any system like this is to load the data in from a source of some form,
apply an analysis technique to each data point then pass this data into the classification system.

From the classification system you should then be able to get the classified and actual year for
each data point which can then have validation performed on it. This architecture is summed up in
figure~\ref{fig:basic-arch}.

Building up from this it is apparent that to implement the analysis and classification steps that 
there is a need to implement the factory method design 
pattern\cite[p.~93-100]{Gamma1996Entwurfsmuster}. Reading from a data source should be a simple
matter of reading from a file, and cross validation has already been decided to use leave-one-out
cross validation.

Figure~\ref{fig:factory-arch} shows the design after adding in the factory methods.

From this we then need the two top-level interfaces \verb+Analyser+ and \verb+Classifier+. The 
\verb+Analyser+ interface should have a single method which runs analysis on a painting and return
some form of object which represents the analysed data.

The \verb+Classifier+ class should have a method which takes a single painting and a set of
paintings, returning a year which is the classified year of the single painting based on the set
of paintings.

At this point it is also required that there is a class to store meta-data of a painting. 
Figure~\ref{fig:interfaces-arch} depicts the design after adding in these parts.
